The motivation for this project was to create an app that would connect fitness instructors with clients without having to join a gym. The UI of this project focused on developing a general theme and building landing and about marketing pages.

## Tech/framework used:
**Built with**
- HTML
- CSS

## Credit:
A huge shout out to the entire team at Lambda School. The expereince so far has been amazing and I can't wait to see what I learn next. Also, thank you to Sam, Andre, and Natalie for being awesome partners during this build week. Your feedback and encouragement has made this week totally worth it.

### Front End:
Unit-2

## Motivation:
The purpose of "Anywhere Fitness" is to make fitness possible anywhere! We wanted to connect clients with personal trainers and personal trainers with clients.

The app will be able to allow instructors can take attendance, request and process payments, create virtual “punch passes” for each type of class offered, alert clients of cancellations or location changes and so much more. Clients can easily find out information on classes - location, class size, start time and duration, as well as reschedule or cancel an upcoming appointment or reservation right from the mobile app. We hope to make our services more dynamic and evolved as we grow!


## Tech/Framework Used:
Base:
  - create-react-app
  - axios
  - yup

Styling:
  - styled components
  - reactstrap bootstrap
  - GSAP

### Front End:
Unit-3

## Motivation:
 We wanted to figure out a way to connect trainers and trainees in an easy and convenient way. These days, fitness classes can be held anywhere- a park, an unfinished basement or a garage- not just at a traditional gym. Certified fitness instructors need an easy way to take the awkwardness out of attendance taking and client payment processing.

## Tech/Framework Used:
  - React
  - Reactstrap
  - Context API
  - GSAP

## Credit:
Lambda School inspired (required) me to make this project. A big thanks to Andre Michalowski and Brandon O'Neal for helping build all the various aspects of the project and being willing to contribute whenever needed. Also, a big thank you to Natalie Davis for being an awesome Project Lead and helping us all stay focused and motivated!
